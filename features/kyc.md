# KYC/AML

Know your customer (KYC) is the process of a business verifying the identity of its clients and estimating potential risks of illegal intentions for the business relationship.

TokenD system provides a powerful set of data agnostic tools for easy implementation of custom KYC procedure based on the regulations of a specific jurisdiction. 

For example, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws requires financial institutions (FIs) to know who their customers are sending money to and who their customers are receiving money from. In some jurisdictions banks are able to trust the AML procedures of other licensed banks. 

**AML alert** is a special operation that takes care of the situations when your 
user have got his tokens in unexpected way.
It may be caused by software bug, when tokens were issued unexpectedly, or 
legal reasons - user is not 
allowed to hold some tokens in his account. It completely destroys tokens not 
only from the provided userâ€™s balance but 
from the system itself (similar to withdrawal). 

Tasks based approach allows to do various verification steps which could include manual verification as well as integration with external system which can provide sanction lists screening, documents verification, etc.
